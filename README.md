### Detailed Pipeline
#### 1. Chatbot Configuration

**Steps:**
1. **Create Chatbot** → Generate unique ID
2. **Set Name & Purpose** → Define chatbot identity
3. **Configure Initial Prompt** → Set personality and constraints
4. **Save Configuration** → Store in database with dedicated vector namespace

**Initial Prompt Example:**
```
You are a professional assistant. Answer only from provided documents.
Always cite sources. Be concise and accurate.
```

**5.2 Weighted Reranking**
```
final_score = (0.6 × semantic_score) + (0.4 × keyword_score)
```

**5.3 Retrieval**
- Get top 5-10 chunks per sub-query

## AI Enrollment & Admissions Agent
### Overview Proposed Workflow
![Image](images/ea/enrollment.png)

### Detailed Pipeline
#### 1. **User/Applicant → Orchestrator**

**What happens:** A user takes photos of their 3 documents using their phone or webcam
- 📱 National ID card photo
- 📜 Degree/Certificate photo  
- 📄 Birth certificate photo

The **Master Orchestrator Agent** receives these images and manages the entire process.

#### 2. **Orchestrator → Document Analysis Agent (Step 1)**

**What happens:** The Document Analysis Agent scans all 3 documents

**Extracts:**
- Full name from each document
- Date of birth
- ID number
- School name (from certificate)
- Issue dates
- Any other text fields

**Example output:**
```
National ID: 
- Name: "John Smith"
- ID: "123456789"
- DOB: "1998-05-15"

Degree Certificate:
- Name: "John Smith"
- School: "State University"
- Graduation: "2022-06-20"

Birth Certificate:
- Name: "John Smith"
- DOB: "1998-05-15"
- Parents: "Mary & Robert Smith"
```

#### 3. **Parallel Processing (Steps 2a & 2b)**

**2a - Validation Agent checks:**
- ✅ Are all required fields present? (name, DOB, ID number)
- ✅ Do names match? ("John Smith" on all 3 documents?)
- ✅ Are ID numbers in correct format?

**2b - Fraud Detection Agent analyzes (simultaneously):**
- 🔍 Looking for visual tampering (edited photos, misaligned text)
- 🔍 Checking font consistency (all text same style?)
- 🔍 Detecting photoshop/digital manipulation
- 🔍 Comparing document templates to known legitimate ones
- 🔍 Checking if documents look authentic

Both agents work **at the same time** to save processing time.

#### 4. **Results → Decision Making Agent (Step 3)**
The Decision Agent receives:
- Validation Result: "PASSED" or "FAILED" or "WARNING"
- Risk Score: "LOW" or "MEDIUM" or "HIGH"

**Decision Logic:**
- ✅ Validation PASSED + Risk LOW = **Auto Approve**
- ❌ Validation FAILED = **Auto Reject** 
-⚠️ Risk HIGH = **Auto Reject**
- 🤔 Validation WARNING or Risk MEDIUM = **Manual Review**


#### 5. **Three Possible Paths:**

**A. Auto Approve** - Everything looks perfect
- User is eligible
- Documents are authentic
- Goes straight to database

**B. Auto Reject** - Clear problems found
- Missing required info
- Obvious fake document
- Goes to database with rejection reason

**C. Manual Review** - Something suspicious but not conclusive
- Admin sees original photos
- Admin sees what the AI found suspicious
- Admin can override and approve OR confirm rejection
- All admin actions are logged

#### 6. **Database Storage**
Saves everything:
- Student profile (structured data)
- Original document images
- Validation results
- Fraud detection findings
- Final decision
- Complete audit trail (who did what, when)

#### 7. **Notification**
- ✅ "Congratulations! Your enrollment is approved"
- ❌ "Sorry, your application was rejected because: [reason]"
- 🕐 "Your application is under review"

### Pipeline Flow Summary
**User uploads documents:**

1. **Orchestrator** receives 3 photos
2. **Document Analysis** extracts:
   - Name: "Sarah Johnson" (all docs)
   - DOB: "2003-03-15" 
   - ID: "987654321"
   - School: "City High School"
   - Graduation: "2022-05-30"

3. **Parallel Processing:**
   - **Validation**: ✅ All fields present, ✅ Names match, ✅ Age 21, ✅ Dates logical
   - **Fraud Detection**: ⚠️ Medium risk - font on ID looks slightly different

4. **Decision**: Manual Review needed (medium risk)

5. **Admin Review**: 
   - Admin checks: "It's just an old ID card with worn text"
   - Admin approves with override

6. **Database**: Stores everything including admin's override reason

7. **Notification**: Sarah gets "Enrollment Approved!" email## AI Enrollment & Admissions Agent
